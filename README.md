***OpenWineMap -- Alpha***

This is a worldwide map that aims to reference all appelations on earth, for now it is only mainland France as a test (sorry Corsica...).
The idea is to show a polygon or a set of polygon as a layer or group of layer on top of the already opensource and opendata "OpenStreetMap", if you click on one of these polygons, you get a popup that list the applations that intersect your click, then if you hover over one of the listed AOC you it should highlight the said appelations polygon...
And finaly if you click this link it should open that appelation's technical sheet, right now there are very few appelation with a tech-sheet (maybe even only one "AOP_Irouleguy" the most South-Western appelation of them all), and they are admitidly pretty sh\*tty, and click on that hyperlink should lock the highlighted polygon until you close the tech-sheet with the vertical transparent bar on the left of this tech...
If you zoom enough on the map the polygons should show an outline of the borders of different thikness, mostly related to their size and importance... On the top right there is a crude layer control that helps you show or hide different regions. The bottom left is a search bar that only works for precisely typed city or village name...

If you are having trouble with speed it probably is because I have a very limited internet connection at home where the site is hosted, you may want to zoom in, it will have less polygons to load.

If you want to hack it please do... but then tell me how you did it at michaelguerga@gmail.com, It's probably not the most secure... Likewise if you have any comments or input on this site or on mistakes I've made send an email and add the object OpenWineMap in it so I may find them easily..

Objectives for Beta version: 
 - Get a cleaner interface, more fluidity...
 - Create a set of browser tools and cross-user checks for un-authenticated users to submit and add new appelations...
 - Make a wiki.
 - Host it for real..

If you are looking at the site via an IP address it might not work anymore I'm doing this from a private router and the lease are not super long, just ask me for the new ip address.

This is an Alpha test of an opensource/opendata project, don't hold back on feed back...
