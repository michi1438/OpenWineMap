***OpenWineMap -- Alpha***

This is a worldwide map that aims to reference all appelations on earth, for now it is only mainland France as a test (sorry Corsica...).
The idea is to show a polygon or a set of polygon as a layer or group of layer that represent the agricultural bounds of each appelation, on top of the already opensource and opendata "OpenStreetMap", if you click on one of these polygons, you get a popup that list the applations that intersect your click coordinates, then if you hover over one of the listed AOC you just got it should highlight the said appelation's polygon...

And finaly if you click this link it should open that appelation's technical sheet, right now there are very few appelation with a tech-sheet (maybe even only one "AOP_Irouleguy" the most South-Western appelation of them all), and they are admitidly pretty sh\*tty, and clicking on that hyperlink should lock the highlighted polygon until you close the tech-sheet with the vertical transparent bar on the left of this new window...

If you zoom enough on the map the polygons should show an outline of the borders of different thikness to help with distinguishing the different shapes, they are mostly related to their size and importance... On the top right there is a crude layer control that helps you show or hide different regions. The bottom left panel is a search bar that only works for precisely typed city or village name...

If you are having trouble with speed it probably is because I have a very limited internet connection at home where the site is hosted, you may want to zoom in, it will have less polygons to load.

If you want to hack it please do... but then tell me how you did it at michaelguerga@gmail.com, It's probably not the most secure... Likewise if you have any comments or input on this site or on mistakes I've made send an email and add the object OpenWineMap in it so I may find them easily..

Objectives for Beta version: 
 - Get a cleaner interface, more fluidity...
 -> Base mod_tile on alpine in an other branch just like the other docker instances should work the same 
 - Create a set of browser tools and cross-user checks for un-authenticated users to submit and add new appelations...
 - Make a wiki.
 - Host it for real.

This is an Alpha test of an opensource/opendata project, don't hold back on feed back...
